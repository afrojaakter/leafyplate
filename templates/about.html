    <h1>About Dailyblog</h1>

    <p>
        We're an AI-powered healthy eating platform built for one simple reason:
        <strong>nobody should have to spend their Sunday evening stressing about what to cook this week.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Dailyblog generates recipes, nutrition articles, and personalized weekly meal plans complete
        with shopping lists. Every ingredient links directly to your grocery store of choice,
        so all you have to do is click, buy, and cook.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Believe</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthy eating should be easy.</strong> If it requires a PhD in nutrition to plan your meals, something's broken.</li>
        <li><strong>Real food, not fads.</strong> We don't do cleanses, detoxes, or "guilt-free" anything. Food is fuel and joy — no guilt required.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety matters.</strong> You won't see the same chicken breast recipe five times a week here.</li>
        <li><strong>Budget-friendly by default.</strong> Eating well shouldn't require a second mortgage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <p>
        Our AI reads hundreds of food blogs, nutrition research papers, and recipe sources every day.
        It identifies the most interesting, practical, and delicious ideas — then creates original content
        inspired by what it finds. Every recipe is unique to Dailyblog.
    </p>

    <p>
        For our email subscribers, we go a step further: personalized weekly meal plans tailored to your
        dietary preferences, cooking skill, schedule, and budget. Busy Tuesday? You get a 15-minute dinner.
        Sunday meal prep day? We plan your batch cooking session.
    </p>

    <h2>A Note About AI</h2>

    <p>
        We're transparent about this: our content is generated with AI assistance (Google Gemini).
        Nutrition information is estimated and should not replace professional dietary advice.
        We believe AI is a tool that can make healthy eating more accessible — not a replacement
        for human expertise.
