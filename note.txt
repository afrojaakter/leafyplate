Dailyblog — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Product Vision
Dailyblog is an AI-powered healthy eating platform that generates personalized weekly meal plans, recipes, and grocery shopping lists — with every ingredient linked to real, purchasable grocery products.

One-liner: "We plan your meals, build your shopping list, and link you straight to the checkout."

Tagline: "Fresh ideas. Real food. Zero nonsense."

Inspiration: Applies the Roomellow "retrieval-first" model to food. Just as Roomellow recommends real furniture SKUs you can buy, Dailyblog recommends real grocery products you can add to your cart.

2. Problem Statement
Busy people (like you, your husband, and your sister) face these daily pain points:

"What should I cook?" — Decision fatigue around meals, especially on weeknights
"What do I need to buy?" — Building grocery lists from scratch every week
"I don't want to think about this" — The mental load of meal planning, nutrition balancing, and variety
"I want to just order/pick up" — Shopping should be one click, not 30 minutes of browsing
Existing solutions (recipe blogs, meal kit services) either require too much work from the user or are too expensive ($10+/serving for meal kits).

3. Target Users
Persona	Description
Busy Professional	Works full-time, wants healthy meals but hates planning. Willing to grocery shop or order delivery.
Health-Conscious Parent	Feeds a family, needs variety, budget-aware, meal preps on weekends.
Fitness-Oriented	Tracks macros/calories, needs high-protein options, wants nutrition data.
Initial users: 3 (you, husband, sister). Scale target: Public launch with subscriber signups.

4. Product Components
4A. Public Blog (Content Marketing + SEO)
AI-generated content published daily to a static site:

Content Type	Frequency	Purpose
Recipes	2/day	SEO traffic, showcase cooking style
Nutrition Articles	1/day	Authority building, health content
Myth Busters	Every 3 days	Engagement, shareability
Weekly Meal Plans	Sundays	Lead magnet → email signups
Each recipe includes a "Shop the Ingredients" section with affiliate links to grocery products.

4B. Personalized Email Service (Core Product)
Weekly personalized meal plans delivered to subscribers:

Deliverable	Timing	Content
Weekly Meal Plan	Sunday evening	7-day plan (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack) tailored to subscriber profile
Shopping List	With meal plan	Grouped by store section, quantities for household size, with product links
Tonight's Dinner	Daily 4 PM (optional)	Quick reminder with just that night's recipe
4C. Shoppable Shopping List (Monetization Layer)
The Roomellow-inspired feature. Every ingredient in a shopping list maps to a real grocery product:


Shopping List — Week of Jan 28, 2026
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PRODUCE
  ✓ Broccoli crowns (2 lbs)          [Buy on Walmart →] [Buy on Amazon Fresh →]
  ✓ Sweet potatoes (3 lbs)           [Buy on Walmart →] [Buy on Amazon Fresh →]
  ✓ Baby spinach (5 oz bag)          [Buy on Walmart →] [Buy on Amazon Fresh →]

PROTEIN
  ✓ Chicken thighs, boneless (2 lbs) [Buy on Walmart →] [Buy on Amazon Fresh →]
  ✓ Canned chickpeas (2 cans)        [Buy on Walmart →] [Buy on Amazon Fresh →]

DAIRY
  ✓ Greek yogurt, plain (32 oz)      [Buy on Walmart →] [Buy on Amazon Fresh →]
How it works:

AI generates a meal plan with specific ingredients
System maps each ingredient to real product listings (via grocery APIs or pre-built product catalog)
Each product links to the grocery store's product page with an affiliate tag
User clicks → buys on Walmart/Amazon/Instacart → Dailyblog earns commission
5. Affiliate / Partner Strategy (Roomellow Model Applied)
Phase 1: Affiliate Links (Launch)
Use existing affiliate programs — no partner deals needed to start:

Program	Commission	How to Join
Amazon Associates	1-5% on grocery	Self-signup at affiliate-program.amazon.com
Walmart Affiliate	1-4% on grocery	Via Impact Radius
Instacart Affiliate	Varies	Apply through Instacart's partner program
Thrive Market Affiliate	$5-40 per referral	Apply at thrivemarket.com/affiliates
Implementation: Append affiliate tags to product URLs. No API integration needed initially — just construct URLs with the right parameters.

Example affiliate URL patterns:


Amazon:    https://amazon.com/dp/B08XYZ?tag=dailyblog-20
Walmart:   https://walmart.com/ip/12345?affiliates_ad_id=dailyblog
Instacart: https://instacart.com/store/product/12345?utm_source=dailyblog
Phase 2: Product Catalog (Post-Launch)
Build a grocery product database (like Roomellow's furniture catalog):

Spoonacular API — Maps ingredients to specific grocery products with prices
Open Food Facts — Free product database with barcodes and nutrition
Manual curation — Build a curated catalog of recommended brands/products
Phase 3: Partner Deals (Growth)
Approach grocery delivery services for direct partnerships:

White-label meal planning for grocery stores (like Roomellow's B2B model)
Sponsored ingredients — Brands pay to be the recommended product for "olive oil" or "Greek yogurt"
"Order Full List" button — Deep link that adds all items to an Instacart/Walmart cart at once (requires partner API access)
6. Subscriber Profile System
Each subscriber has a preference profile:


{
  "name": "Afroj",
  "email": "afroj@example.com",
  "household_size": 2,
  "dietary_restrictions": ["no-pork"],
  "preferences": {
    "cuisine_likes": ["mediterranean", "asian", "mexican"],
    "disliked_ingredients": ["eggplant", "olives"],
    "cooking_skill": "intermediate",
    "max_cooking_time_minutes": 45,
    "meal_prep_friendly": true
  },
  "nutrition_targets": {
    "daily_calories": 1800,
    "high_protein": true
  },
  "schedule": {
    "busy_nights": ["tuesday", "thursday"],
    "meal_prep_day": "sunday"
  },
  "budget": "moderate",
  "preferred_grocery_store": "walmart",
  "delivery_time": "sunday_evening",
  "active": true
}
Key fields:

dietary_restrictions — Allergies, religious, ethical (halal, vegetarian, nut-free)
busy_nights — Get quick meals (<20 min) or leftover assignments
meal_prep_day — Plan accounts for batch cooking
disliked_ingredients — AI avoids these
preferred_grocery_store — Shopping links prioritize this store
household_size — Scales servings and shopping quantities
Phase 1: JSON files per subscriber (family only)
Phase 2: Google Form → JSON conversion (friends)
Phase 3: Web signup form on the blog (public)

7. Technical Architecture

Key New Component: product_linker.py
Maps raw ingredients from AI-generated recipes/meal plans to real grocery products with affiliate links:


# Input:  {"item": "chicken thighs, boneless", "amount": "2", "unit": "lbs"}
# Output: {
#   "item": "chicken thighs, boneless",
#   "amount": "2", "unit": "lbs",
#   "products": [
#     {
#       "store": "walmart",
#       "name": "Great Value Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs, 2.25 lb",
#       "price": "$5.97",
#       "url": "https://walmart.com/ip/12345?affiliates_ad_id=dailyblog",
#       "image_url": "https://..."
#     },
#     {
#       "store": "amazon_fresh",
#       "name": "365 by Whole Foods Market Chicken Thighs Boneless Skinless",
#       "price": "$6.99",

#       "image_url": "https://..."
#     }
#   ]
# }
Approach options:

Spoonacular API — Has a mapIngredientsToGroceryProducts endpoint (but limited on free tier)
Pre-built catalog — Manually curate top 200 common grocery items with affiliate links per store
Search URL fallback — If no exact product match, link to a store search: walmart.com/search?q=boneless+chicken+thighs
Recommended: Start with option 3 (search URL fallback) for launch. Build the curated catalog over time.

8. Visual Design
Palette: Warm off-white (#FAFAF7), burnt orange accent (#E07A3A), sage green (#5B8C5A), dark brown text (#2D2A24). Dark mode support.
Typography: DM Serif Display (headings), Inter (body) — Google Fonts
Layout: 740px articles, 960px index/meal plans. Mobile-first responsive.
Logo: 🥬 dailyblog
Shopping list styling: Checkbox list with store badges (colored pills: blue for Walmart, orange for Amazon, green for Instacart)
9. AI Content Voice
Warm, encouraging, slightly irreverent. Not preachy or clinical.
Anti-diet-culture: No "guilt-free", "skinny", "cheat meal" language
Practical: Every post should teach something actionable
Honest about AI: Footer disclaimer that content is AI-generated. Nutrition info labeled "estimated."
Short intros: No 800-word life stories before the recipe
10. Monetization Summary
Revenue Stream	Phase	Effort	Revenue Potential
Affiliate links (Amazon, Walmart)	Launch	Low — just URL construction	$0.05-0.50 per shopping list click-through
Thrive Market referrals	Launch	Low — apply to program	$5-40 per new member signup
Sponsored ingredients	6+ months	Medium — need traffic first	$50-500/month per brand slot
White-label for grocery stores	12+ months	High — B2B sales	$1K-5K/month per partner
Premium subscriber tier	6+ months	Medium — need user base	$5-10/month per subscriber
