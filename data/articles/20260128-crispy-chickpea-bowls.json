  "intro_html": "<p>If you think chickpeas are boring, you haven't roasted them yet. Twenty-five minutes in a hot oven transforms canned chickpeas into crispy, golden nuggets that shatter when you bite into them. Toss them with warm spices and pile them on a grain bowl, and you've got a meal that's packed with protein, fiber, and actual flavor.</p><p>This is the kind of dinner that works on a busy Tuesday or a lazy Sunday. It's endlessly customizable — swap the grains, change the vegetables, drizzle whatever sauce lives in the back of your fridge. The chickpeas are the star, and they're hard to mess up.</p>",

    "Try adding: avocado, pickled red onion, feta crumbles, or a fried egg on top."
