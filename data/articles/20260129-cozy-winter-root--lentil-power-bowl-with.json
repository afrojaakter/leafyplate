      "step": 2,
      "text": "In a large bowl, combine the diced sweet potato, carrots, parsnips, and red onion. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, rosemary, thyme, smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp salt, and black pepper. Toss well to ensure all the veggies are coated. Spread them in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet."

    {
      "step": 3,
      "text": "Roast for 30-40 minutes, flipping halfway through, or until the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized at the edges. Keep an eye on them – you want them golden and sweet, not burnt!"
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "text": "While the vegetables are roasting, prepare the lentils. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed lentils, vegetable broth (or water), the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until lentils are tender but still hold their shape. Drain any excess liquid and remove the bay leaf."

      "step": 5,
      "text": "While everything is cooking, whisk together the dressing ingredients: tahini, lemon juice, water (start with 3 tbsp and add more until it reaches a pourable consistency), minced garlic, maple syrup (if using), and 1/4 tsp salt. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. You want it tangy, creamy, and bright!"
    },
    {
      "step": 6,
      "text": "To assemble your power bowls, divide the cooked lentils among four bowls. Top with the roasted root vegetables. Drizzle generously with the lemon-tahini dressing. Garnish with fresh parsley and toasted pumpkin seeds, if desired."

  "tips": [
    "**Don't crowd the pan!** When roasting vegetables, give them space on the baking sheet. If they're too close, they'll steam instead of roast, preventing those delicious crispy, caramelized edges you're looking for. Use two baking sheets if necessary.",
    "**Lentil Storage:** Cooked lentils can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4-5 days, making this a great meal prep component.",
    "**Customize Your Veggies:** Feel free to swap in other sturdy winter veggies like butternut squash, parsnips, or even Brussels sprouts!"
